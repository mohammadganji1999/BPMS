# BPMS
**Software design for the application process of becoming a teaching assistant by students with Business Process Management System (BPMS)**
A business process management system (BPMS) is a platform that manages and automates well-defined business processes. It creates an infrastructure that enhances company agility, making work faster and easier.A BPMS is a simple, intuitive tool that helps companies execute, manage, and improve business processes by identifying, modeling, automating, and analyzing business processes. It allows enterprises to collect data and use it to optimize key business processes.Business Process Management Software has also taken a new and enhanced form–iBPMS (i stands for ‘intelligent’). An iBPMS uses actionable, real-time insights from operations intelligence to improve the orchestration of adaptive business processes.I used BDMS in my final bachelor’s project. In this project, the process that students go through to become assistant professors has been implemented. In this way, students send their request to the relevant professor by filling in the necessary information. In the continuation of the process, this request will be checked by the professor and vice-chancellor, then the final result will be communicated to the students.
